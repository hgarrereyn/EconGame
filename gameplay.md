# Gameplay

## Overview

The game is divided into days. At the start of the day, the players receive news information about current markets. (*See `News`*)

Players must decide how much to invest in rate multiplier (capital) and resource multiplier (workers). (*See `Allocation`*)

Once a player has submitted any changes to their investments, they are allowed to begin farming resources. (*See `Farming`*)

At the end of the round, all of a players inventory is immediately sold at the market price (which is revealed) and a player's profit is listed. (*See `Profit`*)

## News



## Spawn

The player spawns in a random location with 100p.

## Movement

Players move with WASD keys and hold SPACE to farm a resource.

## Farming a resource

There are four different types of resources on the map (represented by different colors and shapes).
Players must be within 0.5 units to farm a resource.
Once a player enters the farming area, they hold space to farm the resource.
As the player farms, the action bar moves around at a rate proportional to the player's capital level.

Once the action completes, the player receives inventory proportional to the amount of workers.
